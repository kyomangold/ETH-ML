# Introduction to Machine Learning

This is the repository for the code files of the **Introduction to Machine Learning** lecture at the [Learning and Adaptive Systems Group](https://las.inf.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich taught by Prof. Dr. Andreas Krause and Prof. Dr. Fan Yang. The lecture covered the following topics

- Linear regression (overfitting, cross-validation/bootstrap, model selection, regularization, [stochastic] gradient descent)
- Linear classification: Logistic regression (feature selection, sparsity, multi-class)
- Kernels and the kernel trick (Properties of kernels; applications to linear and logistic regression); k-nearest neighbor
- Neural networks (backpropagation, regularization, convolutional neural networks)
- Unsupervised learning (k-means, PCA, neural network autoencoders)
- The statistical perspective (regularization as prior; loss as likelihood; learning as MAP inference)
- Statistical decision theory (decision making based on statistical models and utility functions)
- Discriminative vs. generative modeling (benefits and challenges in modeling joint vy. conditional distributions)
- Bayes' classifiers (Naive Bayes, Gaussian Bayes; MLE)
- Bayesian approaches to unsupervised learning (Gaussian mixtures, EM)

The repository contains a folder with the code to the compulsory capstone projects, where all of the theoretical knowledge of the lecture had to be applied.
